    A playful real-time anonymous chat app that instantly pairs you with a random stranger based on mood.

anonymously, reveal their identity only if they want, and skip to the Next Match until no one is left in the queue.

Features include:
  ⚡ Random real-time matching using a lightweight WebSocket backend
  🔄 “Next Match” — re-enter the queue instantly until no users left
  🔐 Anonymous chatting with optional identity reveal
  😎 Mood badges + Emoji avatars
  🟢 Presence status & typing indicators
  💬 Real-time chat with offline message queue (WorkManager)
  🗂 Paging 3 message history + Room persistence
  🎨 Modern Jetpack Compose UI with smooth animations

  This repository contains the full Android client and Ktor backend (matchmaking queue + real-time chat rooms).
Perfect portfolio project to showcase real-time communication, matchmaking logic, clean architecture, and
production-grade mobile development.
